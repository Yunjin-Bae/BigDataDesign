<i>Here's a concise summary of my project: I used General Social Survey (GSS) data to analyze two main aspects. First, I investigated how the survey year relates to the average age at which people marry, separately for men and women. I calculated yearly averages and standard deviations and visualized the relationship with scatter plots.

Second, I explored the link between individuals' highest education level and their age at marriage. I calculated the average age at marriage based on education level and visualized it using scatter plots. </i>

### 2.1  Survey Yearwise first Marriage Age Statistics<br>

This is a statistical analysis of the average first marriage age by survey year. The analysis is conducted separately for women and men, and it includes the calculation of mean, median, and standard deviation for each group
