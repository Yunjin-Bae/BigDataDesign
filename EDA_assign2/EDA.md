<i>"Here's a concise summary of my project: I used General Social Survey (GSS) data to analyze two main aspects. First, I investigated how the survey year relates to the average age at which people marry, separately for men and women. I calculated yearly averages and standard deviations and visualized the relationship with scatter plots.

Second, I explored the link between individuals' highest education level and their age at marriage. I calculated the average age at marriage based on education level and visualized it using scatter plots. </i>
